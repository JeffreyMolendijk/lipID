Description: lipID is an extremely fast implementation for rule-based matching of
    lipid compounds from MS/MS spectra. While the package logic and libraries
    is based on LipidMatch package, the implementation has been completely
    rewritten to improve the performance (100x speed), and make it compatible
    with the latest R releases and tidyverse workflows. lipID also allows
    users to add custom libraries to search against.
