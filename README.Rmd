lipID is an extremely fast implementation for rule-based matching of
lipid compounds from MS/MS spctra. While the package logic and libraries
is based on LipidMatch pakcage, the implementation has been completely
rewritten to improve the performance (100x speed), and make it compatible
with the latest R releases and tideverse workflows.`lipID` also allows
users to add custom libraries to search against.

## Installation

You can install lipID from [GitHub](https://github.com/lipID) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ahmohamed/lipID")
```
## input
### MS2 files
Files containing MS2 spectra should be converted to `ms2` format. You can use MSConvert to do so.

### Features table (optional)
A CSV file with MS1 features, intensities for each sample. First and second column should have MZ and RT values. ([see example here](inst/extdata/features.csv))

## Quick example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve use lipID to annotate untargeted lipidomics:

```{r example}
library(lipID)

# Replace with a path to your ms2 files or their containing folder.
ms2_file <- "inst/extdata/ms2file.ms2"

# Replace with a path to your features table CSV file
features_file <- "inst/extdata/features.csv"

# Get a list of libraries for matching
libs <- get_libs(mode = 'Pos', acq = 'dda')

annotated <- lipID(ms2_file, libs, features_file)
head(annotated)
```
